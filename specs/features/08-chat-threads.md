# Threads

* **Sidebar** — new chat, switch thread, delete (`src/components/ChatSidebar.svelte`)
* Persisted in `sessionStorage` (`chat-threads`, `chat-active-thread-id`)
* Cleared on intentional sign out via `clearAllChatState()`
* Cleared when browser session ends (sessionStorage semantics)

See [.agents/skills/modules/chat-threads.md](../../.agents/skills/modules/chat-threads.md).
